## Introduction

Over the past couple of years, I've been searching for an efficient way to verify file hashes, ensuring the file remains unchanged and checking its hash against VirusTotal for potential threats.

I primarily sought a free, lightweight program that could check a file's hash with just a few clicks, avoiding the need to manually enter the file path in Windows PowerShell using the "Get-FileHash" command or the "sha1sum" or "sha256" commands in a Linux terminal.

Believing there had to be a more straightforward solution, I conducted some online research and discovered the [OpenHashTab](https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab) repository on GitHub. Its features perfectly matched my needs, and I initially thought it was too good to be true. After installing the latest release and using it for the past year, it has saved me considerable time, making the process of scanning and checking file hashes almost effortless.

## Use Case Example

There are many features and ways to use OpenHashTab but I'll showcase the main way I use it on a daily basis.

First I'll download a file from the internet, in this case, an executable of [Paint 3D](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh5fv99?hl=en-us&gl=US) from the Microsoft store.

Then I'll head to my downloads folder where the executable is and right click on the file to open the context menu and then click the "Hashes" button in the list to open the file in OpenHashTab.

In OpenHashTab, I see 4 common hashes for the file (OpenHashTab currently has support for 28 hashing algorithms).

I then want to do a quick check of the hash with VirusTotal so I click the VirusTotal logo button.

With this file, it hasn't been uploaded to VirusTotal before so I see the text "Not found in database". This somewhat surprised me that it hasn't been uploaded before, so I went to the VirusTotal website on my browser and uploaded it so I would get the result I usually see.

After uploading the file and checking again with FileHashTab, I see that the file is now in VirusTotal's database and that it has 0/76 detections. I can double click the VirusTotal field to copy the text and then I can paste that into my browser to see the full webpage and the result of the scan.

In addition to the features mentioned, I can easily verify the hashes generated by OpenHashTab by comparing them with those provided by the file's author or, in this case, the hash generated by VirusTotal. This ensures that the hash from OpenHashTab matches the one scanned by VirusTotal.

To do this, I copied the hash generated by VirusTotal in my browser and pasted it into the "Check against:" text input box inside OpenHashTab. As soon as the hash is pasted, the input box turns green, indicating a successful match with one of the algorithms. In this example, the green input box shows that the hash match was from the SHA-256 algorithm and that the file name is "Paint 3D Installer.exe."
